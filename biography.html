        <h3>CS Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>Through classes and internships, I have developed a diverse portfolio of computer science skills. I am most experienced in Python, using it in in full stack development as well as data analysis. I also have experience in front-end development with HTML, CSS, React, Flask, and JavaScript. In addition to my Computer Science degree, I am minoring in Data Science and have experience using R and Tableau.</p>
        <h3>More About Me...</h3>
        <p>Growing up, my life was centered around sports. I played baseball, soccer, basketball and volleyball growing up and still enjoy watching all of them professionally. I am a huge fan of the Boston Red Sox, New York Giants, US Soccer, and unfortunately grew up rooting for Northwestern sports. I also love movies and am constantly continuing my never-ending quest to watch as many possible in my lifetime. I enjoy playing guitar, doing the New York Times crossword puzzle, and hanging out with my family's cats, Cody and Ollie.</p>
        <p>Speaking of movies, I think this EMBEDDED YOUTUBE VIDEO of a random girl playing the Interstellar theme song is very cool.</p>
